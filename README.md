# Random-Quote-Generator
Treehouse Full-Stack Javascript Techdegree Unit 1 Project

"For this first project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You will select your own quotes from famous historical figures, artists, scientists, celebrities, etc.

Please select tasteful, positive and uncontroversial quotes, for the sake of this project. Thank you.

You'll use your growing knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to:

*Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes.
*Write your own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.

This project is a fun and effective way for you to practice basic JavaScript skills while also creating a simple interactive portfolio piece to showcase your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals."
